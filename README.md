# Driving-License-Sindh-Portal

The current Driving License Sindh Portal has no checks on CNIC which is an essential element for uniquely identifying applicants. Users can book with any random CNIC even if it is not registered with NADRA database. We did not have access to NADRAs database but have tried to replicate it by adding a check on CNIC's through datafiles containing sample registered CNIC's. 

This is essential if suppose a security breach is conducted by one of the applicants, and they have a random CNIC registered like "12....3". This is such a big loop hole and anyone can exploit this. This is the current site of DLS: https://dls.sindhpolice.gov.pk/home/app.
